        <a href="https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein </a>. For
        MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about
        <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms"
          >the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.
        </a>

        Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about

          The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022. The

              errata page
            </a>
            that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by
            discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature, allowing
            you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you
            asked about. We stopped logging errors for the third edition in
            January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.

      <h3><i>Algorithms Unlocked</i></h3>
      <p>
        <i>Algorithms Unlocked </i> is a gentler, less technical, entry into
        algorithms than <i>Introduction to Algorithms </i>. It contains some
        mathematics, but not nearly as deep as in
        <i>Introduction to Algorithms </i>. The Amazon site for the book is

        "Removed notable people who barely lived there or people who are not
        notable." Since I lived in Oceanside for the first 18 years of my life,
        I can only conclude that I am not notable.
